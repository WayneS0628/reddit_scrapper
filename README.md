Hey, i have a youtube channel called StoriesFromOver (https://www.youtube.com/@StoriesFromOver)
And I needed a convenient fast way to scrape stories from reddit and at whichever subreddit
i wanted to with however many stories i wanted to. So after a long time of going through PRAW 
documentation, youtube, and arguing with the free version of ChatGPT ive come up with this project.
So far i have two programs one to pull top posts from subreddits and another to pull top posts and 
their replies from subreddits. The next thing im working towards is implmenting all of this functionality
into one file.
